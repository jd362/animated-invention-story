This story happens based on the background of cartoon "Tom and Jerry". The story begins when Tom is working to create 
a piece of cartoon in which he is trying to show people the dangerousness and craftiness of mice based on his painful 
experience of fighting with Jerry.

Tom is a house cat and Jerry is a mouse that lives in the walls of Tom's home. From the very begining they never got along 
with each other. Tom is big and clumsy, while Jerry is little and crafty. 

Some of the things that Jerry does is trick Tom into getting hurt and trick Tom into getting in trouble with his master. 
Both Tom and Jerry fight a lot, but at the end of the day, they are inseparable and cannot seem to get enough of each 
other. 

Finally, Tom and Jerry becomes good friends. Tom promises he will never try to chase and catch Jerry any more and 
Jerry agrees that he will also stop playing tricks on Tom. In celebration of their reconciliation, Tom decide to
invite Jerry to have dinner together. On the sly, however, he poisons the cheese, hoping to kill Jerry and therefore
solve his problem once and for all. Can Jerry see through Tom's scheme? The story of Tom and Jerry proceeds.

But, of course Jerry saw Tom's scheme before it could happen. Since Tom knew that the cheese would be poisoned, he
brought his own slice of cheese to eat. After dinner, Tom went home and started planning his next plan. And the story
of Tom and Jerry lives on.
