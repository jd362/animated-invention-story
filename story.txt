This story happens based on the background of cartoon "Tom and Jerry". The story begins when Tom is working to create 
a piece of cartoon in which he is trying to show people the dangerousness and craftiness of mice based on his painful 
experience of fighting with Jerry.

Some of the things that Jerry does is trick Tom into getting hurt and trick Tom into getting in trouble with his master. 
Both Tom and Jerry fight a lot, but at the end of the day, they are inseparable and cannot seem to get enough of each 
other.
